### Background

CyChecks began as a required assignment in STAT 585 at Iowa State University (ISU). As groups, we were tasked with creating a package that had data and useful functions. My collaborator and peer, Gina Nichols, had the great idea of looking at salary data from our very own university to see if there are any obvious pay disparities. Gina and I are housed in the Agromony department, which seems to have a lot of male faculty but little female representation, despite having a largely female biased graduate program (cite?). We're able to examine salaries because ISU is a land grant school and is, in part, paid for by the taxpayer. We completed the group project with some other people, which was the original [CyChecks](https://github.com/vanichols/CyChecks). [Cy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_the_Cardinal) is ISU's mascot, and Checks because...well you get it. 

The class ended in the spring of 2019, but Gina and I wanted to continue our analysis, mostly because we didn't have enough time to comb through everything we would have liked for the class project. So was born CyChecks2, which is a cleaner version of the original. 

We've focused our analysis on gender because that's what's included in the public dataset. We realize there is likely an interplay between gender and rate (CITE article), however we are limited in our ability to address this interaction given the data we have. Similarly we realize that our research is considering gender as a binary and is ignoring anyone who decided to omit their gender for any reason. 

*If you're interested in some other hiccups that arose when trying to wrangle public salary data skip to the bottom... *
