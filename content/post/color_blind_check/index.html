<p>In my <a href="/2020/03/16/a-prairie-color-palette/">last post</a>, I had some fun and made prototypes of color palettes based on off prairie plants. If I ever get around to making these color palettes into something more, like a package, I’d want to ensure they are color-blind friendly.</p>
<p>This led me to try out Claire McWhite and Claus Wilke’s <a href="https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr">package</a> <code>colorblindr</code> on my palettes. One of the functionalities of <code>colorblindr</code> is that it can display plots as they would appear to a colorblind person. The package wasn’t on CRAN at the time of this posting, but you can download it from github <em>(FYI at the time of this posting I couldn’t get the package to download on my computer (?? idk) so I cloned it from github and built it on my own device)</em></p>
<p>For the sake of this blog post I wanted to view my original palette next to the colorblind version of the palette. I focused my efforts on making sure my palettes would work for red-green colorblindness (Protanopia/Deuteranopia) since those seem to be the most common forms of colorblindness. Therefore I edited the <code>cvd_grid</code> function to only display those two grids.<br />
#### Here’s how my color palettes look:</p>
<p>These first two palettes, which are based off of plants in the bean family and are more discrete in nature seem to be OK for colorblind folks. Cool!</p>

This butterfly milkweed inspired palette is less than optimal in colorblind vision. The light green and light orange seems problematic - it shall be altered!</p>

<p>As a sequential palette, the showy milkweed seems OK! The light pinks are a little hard to differentiate, but they are also kind of hard to differentiate for a non-color blind person.</p>

<p>This sweet cone-flower palette was originally my favorite, but similar to the butterfly milkweed palette above, the light orange and green are hard to differentiate. Perhaps I’ll make this a discrete palette instead of sequential…</p>

<p>While I love the idea of there being a sunflower palette, I’m not sure if this works. Also, yellow doesn’t usually show up well on project screens, especially on a white background.</p>
<p><img src="/post/color_blind_check/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Surprisingly the first of the grass palettes looks decent.</p>
<p><img src="/post/color_blind_check/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I had no hopes for this palette since it is based on red and green. It’s honestly better than I was expecting but still not good enough to export into a package. Oh well!</p>
<p><img src="/post/color_blind_check/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Using <code>colorblindr</code> has given me some good insight into which colors don’t work well in the same palette (mostly oranges and greens). As I move forward with this project and create any new palettes I’ll make sure to continue to use it.</p>
