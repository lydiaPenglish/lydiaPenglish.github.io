I grew up in Rhode Island but consider myself more of a Midwesterner since I've lived in various parts of this part of the country for the last decade.  

I'm interested in data science, curation, and visualization but have had little formal training in computer science. I studied biology for my [undergraduate degree](https://www.carleton.edu/). 

While I initially learned R at the Chicago Botanic Garden, I took it back up again in haste during my Master's Degree at Iowa State University. I've spent many hours willfully ignoring thesis writing in favor of trying out and attempting to "master" (ha!) new things. What I love about R is that it feels like solving a puzzle, it keeps me on my toes, everything is open-source, and the community/online resources are awesome.
