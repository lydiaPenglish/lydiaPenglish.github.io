As groups, we were tasked with creating a package that had data and useful functions. My collaborator and peer, Gina Nichols, had the great idea of looking at salary data from our very own university to see if there are any obvious pay disparities. Gina and I are housed in the Agronomy department, which seems to have a lot of male faculty but little female representation, despite having a largely female biased graduate program (cite?). We\u0026rsquo;re able to examine salaries because ISU is a land grant school and is, in part, paid for by the taxpayer. We completed the group project with some other people, which was the original CyChecks. Cy is ISU\u0026rsquo;s mascot, and Checks because\u0026hellip;well you get it.\nThe class ended in the spring of 2019, but Gina and I wanted to continue our analysis, mostly because we didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough time to comb through everything we would have liked for the class project. So was born CyChecks2, which is a cleaner version of the original.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve focused our analysis on gender because that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s included in the public data set. We realize there is likely an interplay between gender and rate (CITE article), however we are limited in our ability to address this interaction given the data we have. Similarly we realize that our research is considering gender as a binary and is ignoring anyone who decided to omit their gender for any reason.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the hiccups of wrangling public salary data and HR department information then check out the section at the bottom\nWhat we found: This is a work in progress and we are currently wading through things still. But our former shiny app can be found here.\nWrangling issues: You guys, this was a little bit of a doozy. The reason wrangling was such a pain is that the salary database did not indicate any employee\u0026rsquo;s department within the university. And while directory data in theory is public (you can Google anyone to see where they work at Iowa State), that data is not easily scrape-able. Therefore to gain access to this data we had to wade through the back-channels of ISU HR, who were super kind and helpful in giving us the information we wanted.\nBut then we had issues with names. Usually middle names. Middle names were included in the salary data but not the directory data. There were duplicate names. How people designated their middle names changed over time. Sometimes there were hyphens and sometimes there weren\u0026rsquo;t.

I only collected a tiny smidge of the data that are necessary for this type of analysis so many thanks to all the hardworking students who collected the rest of the data, and to Stuart for helping with the analysis.\nPreamble Flowering phenology, or the timing of flowering, has long been a trait studied by scientists, given it\u0026rsquo;s importance for plant reproduction and fitness. Plants that rely on pollen from other plants (i.e. obligate outcrossers) must flowering at the same time other individuals to successfully reproduce. Moreover, if plants rely on pollinators to transfer said pollen then they must ensure that they are flowering at the same time as their pollinators.\nEchinacea angustifolia (hereinafter just Echinacea) is an obligate outcrosser and relies on pollination. It is also a perennial that often flowers multiple times throughout its life, but not necessarily in consecutive years. Plants are usually at least 3 years when they flower for the first time, but sometimes they are more than 15 years old when they flower for the first time. It quickly gets complicated.\nWe know that Echinacea individuals that flower earlier have higher fitness (i.e. higher seed set), which is a common trend across plant species. However we were curious to see if plants were consistent in their flowering phenology. In other words, are the same individual plants flowering earlier each year and therefore having the highest fitness?\nResults of analysis This work will be published eventually and when it does I will put the link right here!\n","date":1585872000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586182915,"objectID":"ef1f08ac84564b057249d4aae8cbebdd","permalink":"/project/echphenology/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/echphenology/","section":"project","summary":"Research on the consistency of flowering phenology in a perennial plant","tags":["R","Prairie"],"title":"Echinacea phenology","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["community ecology","prairie strips"],"content":" Acknowledgements: This project would first and foremost not be possible without the many Iowa farmers and landowners (26!) who let me come on to their property and tromp around their fields. This project would also have been harder and more isolating without the many people who sat on plastic buckets and recorded data while out in the field with me. Field work in Iowa in July and August is often uncomfortably hot and humid. Lastly, thanks to Katherine Goode for statistical advice, my lab group for their guidance, and my committee for keeping me on task.\nPreamble: My Masters\u0026rsquo; thesis research surrounds tallgrass prairie restorations that have been planted within/around production agricultural fields, otherwise known as prairie strips. Prairie strips are a farming conservation practice. They provide much needed pockets of native habitat in Iowa, where nearly the majority of land is privately owned and in agricutural production. But they also help provision ecosystem services like erosion control and water filtration, making them a win-win for sustainable agricultural production.\nI performed a comprehensive survey of the vegetation in these restorations to understand what factors contributed to variation in diversity and abundance of prairie species. I used diversity and abundance as my two metrics because i) we care about the diversity of these plantings both for conservation purposes and for the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning ii) it\u0026rsquo;s important that these in-field restorations are dominated by prairie species and do not become refugia for weeds, which could threaten agricultural production.\nI surveyed the vegetation during the summers of 2018 and 2019. My sampling points were randomly dispersed throughout the prairie strips and I had the same sampling effort across sites, even if they differed in size.\nSome of my findings: (please note: these results are not published yet and are not intended to be cited)\n1) Diversity was largely related to the richness of the seed mix. When sites seeded more species, they had more prairie species. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a surprising result, one might both hypothesize and hope that seeding more species would result in more species being found, but it\u0026rsquo;s a reassuring pattern nonetheless. We also found larger sites to be more diverse, which is a pattern in line with a longstanding pattern in ecology: the species-area relationship.\n2) Very few of our covariates (seed mix richness, site age, size, perimeter:area ratio, and season planted) explained variation in the abundance of different functional groups. Contrary to our expectations, seeding a more diverse mix was not associated with more consistent cover of prairie species. Age was a negative predictor for annual weeds. We expect annual species to be out-competed in a largely perennial community over time, so this finding agreed with our expectations. But we also found age to be a negative predictor of legumes (nitrogen fixing forbs). I don\u0026rsquo;t know why yet\u0026hellip;\n3) The establishment rate (i.e the proportion of the seed mix detected at each site) was not related to any of our covariates. Meaning that seeding more species doesn\u0026rsquo;t result in a higher proportion of those species being detected. There were certain species that were always found wherever they were seeded (a good use of money!), sometimes found wherever they were seeded, and never found wherever they were seeded.\nThis work will eventually be published (fingers crossed\u0026hellip;) and when it does I\u0026rsquo;ll put the link right here!\nOther things I learned: i) Hindsight in research is always 20|20.\nii) Canada thistle and smooth brome are problematic weeds everywhere.\n","date":1585872000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586182915,"objectID":"728495d8f52e20522d1d66863101ec8e","permalink":"/project/stripsveg/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stripsveg/","section":"project","summary":"Masters thesis work on community ecology in agricultural landscapes","tags":["R","Prairie","Grad school"],"title":"Vegetation in prairie strips","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["colors, flowers"],"content":"\rI’ve been inspired by other R packages that have created color palettes based on living organisms. Naturally I decided to try to make a color palette using prairie species. I want to note right away that I didn’t do anything fancy when choosing colors. I merely used the instant eyedropped tool to hover over different pixels in my photos and wrote down the hex codes. Obviously colors will vary based on lighting and shading. I had to be a little arbitrary in picking the essential pixel shades. If a photo is taken from somewhere else (i.e. is not my own) then I’ve noted it as such.\nFor all the botany nerds out there I’ve decided to grab colors from two species in 4 different families. There are obviously WAY too many beautiful flowers to choose from. This is merely a starting point.\ni. The bean family (Fabaceae)\rI started with Purple Prairie Clover (Dalea purpurea), which was an obvious choice for me since it has a lovely contrasting purple/orange color profile.\nI moved onto Leadplant (Amorpha canescens) which has a similar color palette to purple prairie clover. Predominantly purple flowers with orange anthers. However, leadplant also has beautiful red stamens and the overall color of the plant is a lovely gray-green. It is one of my favorite plants.\n\rii. The milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae)\rMilkweeds are becoming increasingly popular in prairie restorations due to the fact that they provide essential forage and habitat for Monarch butterfly larvae.\rButterfly milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa) is one of the few orange prairie flowers. I was actually able to grab a lot of colors from this photo since, for instance, the budding flowers have a nice coral hue and the inner flower structure is creamy yellow. This palette is also a lot louder than the other two - hello bright and beautiful orange!\nI thought I should do another milkweed, so I chose showy milkweed, which has a more color palette that is more similar to the common milkweed we all know. Showy milkweed is just more, well, showy than the common variety.\n\riii. The daily family (Asteraceae)\rI knew I had to make some color palettes from species in the Asteraceae (Daisy) family. After all the Asteraceae is a HUGE plant family (tied for first with the Orchideae). I started with sweet coneflower (Rudbeckia subtermosa), which is related to brown- and black-eyed Susan. I love the brownish red color of the inner disk florets.\nThe other asteraceae flower I chose was Rosinweed (Silphium integrefolium) which has a more traditional sunflower appearance (although it is not in the sunflower genus Helianthus).\n\riv. The grass family (Poaceae)\rGrasses flower too!\nBig bluestem is arguably the most quintessential of the prairie plants. It’s one of the plants that gave the tallgrass prairie the “tall” part of its name. It easily dwarfs me (a meager 5ft I might add) by mid summer. It’s also commonly called turkey foot because of the way its inflorescences are structured. The inflorescences are a maroon-purple color and anthers are both orange and yellow. There is also orange on the stem, often near the nodes. I found it interesting that this color palette is similar to Sweet Coneflower’s but is just naturally more muted.\nSide oats grama grass (Bouteloua curtipendula - one of the funner scientific names to pronounce I may add) is a shorter grass species that has a lovely spike of florets that hang down along one axis. I haven’t gotten a good photo of Side oats while it’s flowering so I snagged a photo from Prairie Moon Nursery’s website. When flowering, Side oats has some beautifully red anthers and pollen.\n\rNext steps:\rThis is all well \u0026amp; good and has been fun for me BUT it’s important to note there are some things I haven’t done that seem like good ideas to continue this project…\n\rCheck for color blindness. The Side Oats palette especially (hello red and green!) seems like it wouldn’t be appropriate for multiple forms of colorblindness but I need to run my colors through a check to be sure of which color combos are robust or not.\rCreate qualitative, sequential, diverging, and accent scales. Some of these palettes already would function well in that regard, but I need to make a more concerted effort to ensure every type of color palette is available to the user.\rPut these colors into an R package so others can easily use them! I’m open to name suggestions…\r\r\r","date":1584316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586182915,"objectID":"766f7eda5f32cd0cc117980978f3a43f","permalink":"/post/a-prairie-color-palette/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/a-prairie-color-palette/","section":"post","summary":"I’ve been inspired by other R packages that have created color palettes based on living organisms.

These two species are warm-season crops, which means they primarily grow during the warm months: May - October. While the whole state seems to green up during the summer, during the off season (November - April (ish)), the soil is largely bare.

Sown in the fall and killed (\u0026ldquo;terminated\u0026rdquo;) in the spring, cover crops are meant to provide continuous cover on the landscape. Besides holding the physical soil in place with their roots, cover crops can also take up excess, available nutrients that might otherwise leave the field.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586182915,"objectID":"1b09ae384eaa2277fd224397c7770aba","permalink":"/project/pfiweeds/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pfiweeds/","section":"project","summary":"Investigation into the effects of cover crops on weed communities","tags":["Grad school","R"],"title":"Cover crops \u0026 Weeds","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582586228,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"/projects/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Research Projects","type":"widget_page"}]
