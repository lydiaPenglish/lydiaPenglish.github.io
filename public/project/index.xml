&lt;h3 id=&#34;acknowledgements&#34;&gt;Acknowledgements:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a collaborate project and would &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; have been possible without the hardworking Gina Nichols and Jarad Niemi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;preamble&#34;&gt;Preamble:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CyChecks began as a required assignment in STAT 585 at Iowa State University (ISU). As groups, we were tasked with creating a package that had data and useful functions. My collaborator and peer, Gina Nichols, had the great idea of looking at salary data from our very own university to see if there are any obvious pay disparities. Gina and I are housed in the Agromony department, which seems to have a lot of male faculty but little female representation, despite having a largely female biased graduate program (cite?). We&amp;rsquo;re able to examine salaries because ISU is a land grant school and is, in part, paid for by the taxpayer. We completed the group project with some other people, which was the original &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vanichols/CyChecks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CyChecks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_the_Cardinal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cy&lt;/a&gt; is ISU&amp;rsquo;s mascot, and Checks because&amp;hellip;well you get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class ended in the spring of 2019, but Gina and I wanted to continue our analysis, mostly because we didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to comb through everything we would have liked for the class project. So was born CyChecks2, which is a cleaner version of the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve focused our analysis on gender because that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s included in the public dataset. We realize there is likely an interplay between gender and rate (CITE article), however we are limited in our ability to address this interaction given the data we have. Similarly we realize that our research is considering gender as a binary and is ignoring anyone who decided to omit their gender for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the hiccups of wrangling public salary data and HR department information then check out the section at the bottom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-we-found&#34;&gt;What we found:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a work in progress and we are currently wading through things still. But our former shiny app can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://vanichols.shinyapps.io/myapp/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrangling-issues&#34;&gt;Wrangling issues:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You guys, this was a little bit of a doozy. The reason wrangling was such a pain is that the salary database did not indicate any employee&amp;rsquo;s department within the university. And while directory data in theory is public (you can google anyone to see where they work at Iowa State), that data is not easily scrape-able. Therefore to gain access to this data we had to wade through the backchannels of ISU HR, who were super kind and helpful in giving us the information we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then we had issues with names. Usually middle names. Middle names were included in the salary data but not the directory data. There were duplicate names. How people designated their middle names changed over time. Sometimes there were hyphens and sometimes there weren&amp;rsquo;t. The list goes on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;acknowledgements&#34;&gt;Acknowledgements:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a project I started when I worked as a technician for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://echinaceaproject.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Echinacea Project&lt;/a&gt;, which is a research group headed by Stuart Wagenius at Northwestern Univeristy/The Chicago Botanic Garden that investigates the effects of habitat fragmentation on the narrow-leaved purple coneflower, &lt;em&gt;Echinacea angustifolia&lt;/em&gt;. I only collected a tiny smidge of the data that are necessary for this type of analysis so many thanks to all the hardworking students who collected the rest of the data, and to Stuart for helping with the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;preamble&#34;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flowering phenology, or the timing of flowering, has long been a trait studied by scientists, given it&amp;rsquo;s importance for plant reproduction and fitness. Plants that rely on pollen from other plants (i.e. obligate outcrossers) must flowering at the same time other individuals to succesfully reproduce. Moreover, if plants rely on pollinators to transfer said pollen then they must ensure that they are flowering at the same time as their pollinators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echinacea angustifolia&lt;/em&gt; (hereinafter just &lt;em&gt;Echinacea&lt;/em&gt;) is an obligate outcrosser and relies on pollination. It is also a perennial that often flowers multiple times throughout its life, but not necessarily in consecutive years. Plants are usually at least 3 years when they flower for the first time, but sometimes they are more than 15 years old when they flower for the first time. It quickly gets complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that &lt;em&gt;Echinacea&lt;/em&gt; individuals that flower earlier have higher fitness (i.e. &lt;a href=&#34;https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2745.12262&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;higher seed set&lt;/a&gt;), which is a common trend &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01601.x&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;across plant species&lt;/a&gt;. However we were curious to see if plants were consistent in their flowering phenology. In other words, are the same individual plants flowering earlier each year and therefore having the highest fitness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work will be published eventually and when it does I will put the link right here!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vegetation in prairie strips</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;acknowledgements&#34;&gt;Acknowledgements:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project would first and foremost not be possible without the many Iowa farmers and landowners (26!) who let me come on to their property and tromp around their fields. This project would also have been harder and more isolating without the many people who sat on plastic buckets and recorded data while out in the field with me. Field work in Iowa in July and August is often uncomfortably hot and humid. Lastly, thanks to Katherine Goode for statistical advice, my lab group for their guidance, and my committee for keeping me on task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;preamble&#34;&gt;Preamble:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Masters&amp;rsquo; thesis research surrounds tallgrass prairie restorations that have been planted within/around production agricultural fields, otherwise known as &lt;a href=&#34;www.prairiestrips.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;prairie strips&lt;/a&gt;. Prairie strips are a farming conservation practice. They provide much needed pockets of native habitat in Iowa, where nearly the majority of land is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nrcm.org/documents/publiclandownership.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;privately owned&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.extension.iastate.edu/soils/crop-and-land-use-statewide-data&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;agricutural production&lt;/a&gt;. But they also help provision ecosystem services like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23099945&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;erosion control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2014/nrs_2014_zhou-x_001.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;water filtration&lt;/a&gt;, making them a win-win for sustainable agricultural production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I performed a comprehensive survey of the vegetation in these restorations to understand what factors contributed to variation in diversity and abundance of prairie species. I used diveristy and abundance as my two metrics because i) we care about the diveristy of these plantings both for conservation purposes and for the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning ii) it&amp;rsquo;s important that these in-field restorations are dominated by prairie species and do not become refugia for weeds, which could threaten agricultural production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I surveyed the vegetation during the summers of 2018 and 2019. My sampling points were randomly dispersed throughout the prairie strips and I had the same sampling effort across sites, even if they differed in size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-of-my-findings&#34;&gt;Some of my findings:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(please note: these results are not published yet and are not intended to be cited)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Diveristy was largely related to the richness of the seed mix. When sites seeded more species, they had more prairie species. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a suprising result, one might both hypothesize and hope that seeding more species would result in more species being found, but it&amp;rsquo;s a reassuring pattern nonetheless. We also found larger sites to be more diverse, which is a pattern in line with a longstanding pattern in ecology: the species-area relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Very few of our covariates (seedmix richness, site age, size, perimeter:area ratio, and season planted) explained variation in the abundance of different functional groups. Contrary to our expectations, seeding a more diverse mix was not associated with more consistent cover of prairie species. Age was a negative predictor for annual weeds. We expect annual species to be outcompeted in a largely perennial community over time, so this finding agreed with our expectations. But we also found age to be a negative predictor of legumes (nitrogen fixing forbs). I don&amp;rsquo;t know why yet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The establishment rate (i.e the proportion of the seedmix detected at each site) was not related to any of our covariates. Meaning that seeding more species doesn&amp;rsquo;t result in a higher proportion of those species being detected. There were certain species that were always found wherever they were seeded (a good use of money!), sometimes found wherever they were seeded, and never found wherever they were seeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work will eventually be published (fingers crossed&amp;hellip;) and when it does I&amp;rsquo;ll put the link right here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-things-i-learned&#34;&gt;Other things I learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i) Hindsight in research is always 20|20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ii) Canada thistle and smooth brome are problematic weeds everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;acknowledgements&#34;&gt;Acknowledgements:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; bigger than me. The primary investigator is Gina Nichols in conjuction with Stefan Gailans and Sarah Carlson at Practical Farmers of Iowa. Further support was provided by Matt Liebman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Thoughts are my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-short-preamble&#34;&gt;A short preamble:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Iowa, the major cropping system is a two-year rotation of corn and soybeans. These two species are warm-season crops, which means they primarily grow during the warm months: May - October. While the whole state seems to green up during the summer, during the off season (November - April (ish)), the soil is largely bare. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to imagine that having no vegetation for at least half the year + precipitation will result in massive amounts of erosion and nutrient runoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter cover crops.&lt;/strong&gt; Sown in the fall and killed (&amp;ldquo;terminated&amp;rdquo;) in the spring, cover crops are meant to provide continuous cover on the landscape. Besides holding the physical soil in place with their roots, cover crops can also take up excess, available nutrients that might otherwise leave the field.&lt;/p&gt;
