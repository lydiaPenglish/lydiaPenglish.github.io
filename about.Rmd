I'm a Masters' student at Iowa State University straddling three areas: agronomy, sustainable agriculture, and ecology & evolutionary biology. I work on a project called [STRIPS](https://www.nrem.iastate.edu/research/STRIPS/) which integrates production and conservation land onto the same acreage. 

I hail from the small state of Rhode Island, but consider myself a midwesterner since I've spent the last 10 years here.
